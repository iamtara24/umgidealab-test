# Project CMS Admin - E-Commerce

## Apology

I would like to extend my apologies to HR and Mr. Phyo Zaw regarding the application I have created. This application still has many shortcomings due to time constraints. I only started working on this project on Sunday, rather than from Saturday, which caused me to run out of time to complete it perfectly.

Nevertheless, I have made an effort to complete most of the required features and have done my best to finish the project within the remaining time.

Once again, I apologize and thank you for your understanding.
